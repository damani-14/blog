Wrangling and analyzing large amounts of unstructured data is a powerful skill I would like to learn more about.
<br><br>
This post summarizes the preliminary steps toward developing a dynamic web scraper for conducting sentiment analysis.

<hr>
<h4 id="sec1"><b>Summary</b></h4>
<div class="container-fluid">
First, I need a few packages:
</div>

<!---CODE--->
<div class="card">
<pre><code class="language-python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup
from urllib.request import urlopen as uReq
</code></pre>
</div>
<br>

<div class="container-fluid">
Here I'm selecting a webpage, pulling the raw data (html, js):
</div>

<br>

<div class="card">
<pre><code class="language-python"># NPR News: Politics
my_url = 'https://www.npr.org/sections/politics/'

uClient = uReq(my_url)

page_html = uClient.read()

uClient.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<br>

<div class="container-fluid">
Now I can create a 'soup' from the raw data, and parse it into concise summaries of each article:
</div>

<br>

<div class="card">
<pre><code class="language-python">page_soup = soup(page_html, "html.parser")

filename = "nprPolitics.csv"
f = open(filename, "w")
headers = "date, title, summary\n"
f.write(headers)

for article in articles:
    date = article.find("p",{"class":"teaser"}).time["datetime"]
    title = article.div.a.img["alt"]

    for i in range(len(article.find("p",{"class":"teaser"}).text)):
        if article.find("p",{"class":"teaser"}).text[i] == "\x95":
            summary = article.find("p",{"class":"teaser"}).text[i+2:]

    print("date: " + date)
    print("title: " + title)
    print("summary: " + summary, "\n")
    f.write(date + "," + title.replace(", "," ") + "," + summary.replace(", ","") + "\n")
</code></pre>
</div>
