          ESA is developing free open source toolboxes for the scientific exploitation of the Sentinel missions. This work is funded through the "Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions (SEOM)", a new program element of ESA's fourth period of the Earth Observation Envelope Programme (EOEP-4).
          <br><br>
          The toolboxes are inheriting functionality of historical toolboxes developed over the last 10 years and support also a range of National and Third Party Missions. The toolboxes have been conceived to host new functionalities developed by the scientific community in the future. In addition the toolboxes have been specified to be portable on a cloud infrastructure. The toolboxes will be also widely used for training next generation scientists to the scientific exploitation of Sentinel data and multi-mission data.
