        The coastal plain physiographic province in North America comprises numerous coastal counties in southeastern U.S. states. Several kilometers of unconsolidated terrigenous sediments dominate this area, overlying the bedrock. Thus, fault networks and sources of seismic activity are difficult to measure directly. Sixteen permanent Incorporated Research Institutes for Seismology (IRIS) stations currently monitor seismic activity in the state of North Carolina. For the purposes of this study, data acquisition by one temporary seismometer installation near Wilmington, NC and subsequent data analysis was conducted in order to achieve the following: (1) qualitatively describe passive seismic data received within the coastal plain; (2) elucidate the characteristics of background noise using low noise period data; (3) compare data quality to a subset of the IRIS Central Eastern US Network (CEUSN); and (4) determine the desirability of installing a permanent station linked to the IRIS Global Seismographic Network and establishing the University of North Carolina Wilmington as an Advanced National Seismic Survey (ANSS) affiliate within the CEUSN. Low noise models and spectral analysis of data acquired at the Jones Lake station show that the background noise levels at the selected location are sufficiently low enough to detect M 5 and higher seismic events at distances as far as 5,031 km from Jones Lake Station. Furthermore, the station lies sufficiently far enough from other IRIS stations that it may successfully provide greater optimization of the IRIS CEUSN seismic array placement within the Coastal Plain in North Carolina.
